So what if I told you that you could automate farming in Minecraft? Look no further! (If you want the nuts and bolts, skip to the third paragraph) I\'ve been playing Minecraft since I was a wee young lad and Modded Minecraft ever since I discovered this YouTuber named PopularMMOs (yes I was a kid when PopularMMOs was in his heyday). I\'m a huge fan of Factorio, so here recently, and when I say recently, more like in the last five years (basically when early access Factorio came out), I put together a modpack termed "Acer\'s Tiered Minefactory" (forked from my previous pack named "Acer\'s Fantasy World Arena"), which I have since restructured into a REVAMED version for 1.12.2 named "Acer\'s Tiered Minefactory Revamped". The original modpack, "Acer\'s Fantasy World Arena", was actually used in a server I hosted during my highschool years. The modpack was a large conglomeration of magic and "tech" mods, Blood Magic, Thaumcraft, Mekanism, Computer Craft, Industrial Craft 2, and Galacticraft to name a few. At the height of the server, I had around 4 to 6 people playing at a time. Many of my close friends would in fact remember playing on this modded server because I had created an installer for them to configure their Minecraft installations for the server. At its height one of the players had a massive Blood Magic circle that was causing many problems during the playthrough (kek). Anywho, the main premise for the "Fantasy World Arena" was to pose a magic vs tech scenario. My main goal was to progress through enough technological innovation to make it to space and dominate the server with machines. Of course, magic actually won this one unfortunately. A particular blood magic user (COUGH) got so powerful with the voodoo crap the server eventually became unplayable for us techians (lol). This all ocurred over the span of 6 months. Every since, I\'ve never really lost the Modded Mincraft bug. Factorio is great, but something about playing what is essentially Factorio in Minecraft gets me going. So yes, I\'ve been playing modded Minecraft like this for probably 8 years now. It\'s been a great pastime to unwind and set the weeks, years, all of life\'s problems aside.',(0,i.jsx)("br",{}),(0,i.jsx)("br",{}),'I know this is a long winded answer to describe what this project is and why I undertook it. In fact, I still work on this project to this very day. But essentially, I created the Farmbot AI a few years ago to farm potatoes and "hemp" (not weed) plants for Immersive Engineering biodiesel production. The production of these bots would contribute to the sustenance of me (the player), since I eventually expanded the bot\'s manageable farming library, and it would additionally allow for automated farming and power production. This would contribute wholly to progression through each tecnologically innovative tier until the space tier was reached. Believe it or not, I have yet to actually progress through a ',(0,i.jsx)("i",{children:"survival"}),' playthrough of the current modpack and make it to space. It is in theory possible as I have tested it many times in Creative, but survival playthroughs of this modpack are incredibly time consuming. What would take around 15 minutes to set up as a "factory" in Factorio could take upwards of several hours in Minecraft. It took me roughly 20 hours to build and launch a rocket in Factorio. And that by no means is ground breaking. You can imagine how long the process of building a rocket, now with the mod "Advanced Rocketry", would take in Minecraft with the amount of intermediary steps I have set up with this modpack.',(0,i.jsx)("br",{}),(0,i.jsx)("br",{}),'Anyways, enough with the babbling. At this point, Computer Craft is no longer a supported mod (as of 1.12.2). So this was all coded using CC:Tweaked, a fork of Computer Craft, which itself provides a Lua Script api interface for "Turtles" which can be programmatically controlled. OpenComputers was another mod, which I did include in the current pack, that could do the same; however, I chose to develop using CC:Tweaked due to the lower resource cost in constructing a Turtle in CC:Tweaked vs OpenComputers. Essentially, you configure the program within a CC:Tweaked farming turtle with the farm plot bounds and the bot/program takes care of the rest, provided it has a supply of fuel in its origin chest. This program is not advanced by any means really. The statement "AI" is more of allure in stating the program is self sustaining. In fact, a recent addition I\'ve worked on is batch configuration and control using wireless networking by means of a command computer. I have also given the program the ability to save and resume states. I\'ll include pictures of this project below. I have been on the fence on whether this should be a project I highlight on GitHub. This has been more of a personal endeavor for a one-off modded Minecraft playthrough that I have yet to complete. I don\'t think many others would find use of this program other than me, but I could be wrong.
